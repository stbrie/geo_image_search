geo_image_search.py README

A simple script that recurses a given file folder to find geo-tagged images
that are within a half-mile of a given address.  Obviously, if your images
do not have geo-location information, this script help you.  Hopefully it's
useful to you, though.

Additional command-line options do other stuff.

The author uses this on a windows machine with LSB/debian.
